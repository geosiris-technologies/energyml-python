        one other port. There are no semantics for the node except
        common connection. All ports that are connected to a node with
        the same name are inherently connected to each other. The name
        of the node is only required to be unique within the context of
        the current Product Flow Network (that is, not the overall
        model). All ports must be connected to a node and whether or not
        any other port is connected to the same node depends on the
        requirements of the network. Any node that is internally
        connected to only one node is presumably a candidate to be
        connected to an external node. The behavior of ports connected
        at a common node is as follows: a) There is no pressure drop
        across the node. All ports connected to the node have the same
        pressure. That is, there is an assumption of steady state fluid
        flow. b) Conservation of mass exists across the node. The mass
        into the node via all connected ports equals the mass out of the
        node via all connected ports. c) The flow direction of a port
        connected to the node may be transient. That is, flow direction
        may change toward any port if the relative internal pressure of
        the Product Flow Units change and a new steady state is
        achieved.

    A wellbore + MD Interval, or a wellbore completion option would be expected for most tests.  The well, or well completion options could be used for a test commingling flow multiple wellbores or completions.  See the WITSML documentation for Completion for more details. The Reporting Entity option could be used for the testing of some less common combination of sources, eg a cluster of wells.
    NOTE that well, wellbore, well completion, wellbore completion and reporting entity elements are all Data Object References (see Energistics Common documentation). These are used to reference separate data objects which fully describe the real-world facilities concerned.
    However, it is not necessary for the separate data object to exist. The elements can be used as follows:
    - The Title element of the data object reference class is used to identify the name of the real-world facility, eg the well name, as a text string.
    - The mandatory Content Type element would contain the class of the referenced object (the same as the element name).
    - The mandatory  UUID String can contain any dummy uuid-like string.

    Specifies the types of fluid being produced from or injected into a well
    facility.

    :cvar AIR: This is generally an injected fluid.
    :cvar CONDENSATE: Liquid hydrocarbons produced with natural gas that
        are separated from the gas by cooling and various other means.
        Condensate generally has an API gravity of 50 degrees to 120
        degrees and is water white, straw, or bluish in color. It is the
        liquid recovery from a well classified as a gas well. It is
        generally dissolved in the gaseous state under reservoir
        conditions but separates as a liquid either in passing up the
        hole or at the surface. These hydrocarbons, from associated and
        non-associated gas well gas, normally are recovered from lease
        separators or field facilities by mechanical separation.
    :cvar DRY: The well facility is classified as a dry well. It has not
        been nor will it be used to produce or inject any fluids.
    :cvar GAS: The well is classified as a gas well, producing or
        injecting a hydrocarbon gas. The gas is generally methane, but
        may have a mixture of other gases also.
    :cvar GAS_WATER: The well facility is classified as producing both
        gas and water. This classification is to be used when the
        produced stream flow is a mixture of gas and water. When a
        facility produces gas and water in separate streams, it should
        be classified twice as gas and as water.
    :cvar NON_HC_GAS: The well produces or injects non-hydrocarbon
        gases. Typical other gases would be helium and carbon dioxide.
    :cvar NON_HC_GAS_CO2: Carbon dioxide gas.
    :cvar OIL: The liquid hydrocarbon, generally referred to as crude
        oil.
    :cvar OIL_GAS: The well facility is classified as producing both gas
        and oil. This classification is to be used when the produced
        stream flow is a mixture of oil and gas. When a facility
        produces oil and gas in separate streams, it should be
        classified twice as oil and as gas.
    :cvar OIL_WATER: The well facility is classified as producing both
        oil and water. This classification is to be used when the
        produced stream flow is a mixture of oil and water. When a
        facility produces oil and water in separate streams, it should
        be classified twice as oil and as water.
    :cvar STEAM: The gaseous state of water. This is generally an
        injected fluid, but it is possible that some hydrothermal wells
        produce steam.
    :cvar WATER: The well is classified as a water well without
        distinguishing between brine or fresh water.
    :cvar WATER_BRINE: The well facility is classified as producing or
        injecting salt water.
    :cvar WATER_FRESH_WATER: The well facility is classified as
        producing fresh water that is capable of use for drinking or

Each such instance represents a place where a physical feature of the fiber optical path or the facility can be observed as a signal in the DAS data.  For example, a tap test is where a noise (tapping) is generated at a known place (a known location in the facility), and can be seen in the DAS signal at a specific locus.  This fact is recorded in one instance of this object.  Over time it is expected that other commonly used noise generating locations will be listed in the enum for InputPointType.
    Business Rule: Note that it is possible to have a valid Calibration comprising only a collection of DasCalibrationInputPoint. It is not a requirement to also have the corresponding "look up table" of a collection of FiberLocusDepthPoint.  If the receiving application can create its own interpolation of locus depth points then the collection of DasCalibrationInputPoint is all that is needed.

    :ivar facility_length: The ‘facility length’ corresponding to the
        locus. The ‘facility length’ is the length along the physical
        facility (eg measured depth if the facility is a wellbore). This
        length corrects the optical path distance for the offset from
        previous facilities on the same fiber optical path, surface
        patch cord lengths, overstuffing, additional fiber in
        turnaround-subs or H-splices that increase the optical path
        length on the OTDR, but not the actual facility length. Facility
        length is the value which is required to associate the DAS data
        at a locus with a physical location, but at the time of the
        Calibration this may not be known and so this element is
        optional.
    :ivar locus_index: The locus index for the calibration point. Where
        ‘Locus Index 0’ is generally understood to mean, the acoustic
        sample point at the connector of the measurement instrument.
    :ivar optical_path_distance: The optical path distance (ie, the
        distance along the fiber) from the connector of the measurement
        instrument to the acoustic sample point (with the given locus
        index) of the calibration point. Mandatory since any Calibration
        Input Point must have a known optical oath distance.
    :ivar remark: A brief meaningful description of the type of
        calibration point. This is an extensible enumeration type.
        Current reserved keywords are ‘locus calibration’, ‘tap test’
        and ‘last locus to end of fiber’ for commonly used calibration
        points.
    :ivar input_point_kind: The kind of calibration point. This is an
        extensible enumeration type. Current enum values are ‘tap test’
        and ‘other calibration point’. Other commonly used calibration
        points are understood to be packers, sub surface safety valves,
        perforations, all of which give recognizable noise signals
        observed in the DAS data.  At the time of issue of this standard
        there is not a consensus regarding which other values should be
        regarded as standard kinds of calibration input points.

class Calibration:
    """This object contains, for a single facility (defined by its parent Facility
    Calibration), a single Calibration, ie, details of the calibration process and
    results whereby each locus (an acquired data point along the fiber optical
    path) is mapped to a physical location in the facility.

    It is common in DAS processing for such calibrations to be refined
    over time as further data become available.  Each such successive
    calibration can be described using an instance of this object.

    :ivar creation: Date and time the Calibration was created in the
        source application or, if that information is not available,
        when it was saved to the file. This is the equivalent of the ISO
        19115 CI_Date where the CI_DateTypeCode = "creation" Format:

    :ivar last_locus_to_end_of_fiber: This element records the length,
        which can be observed in the DAS data, between the last locus in
        a fiber optical path, and the end of the fiber. As such, this
        distance is a useful input to the calibration process. There
        will only be one such measurement along a fiber optical path,
        that on the last facility before the end of the fiber (eg at the
        bottom a wellbore, in the event that say a flowline and then a
        wellbore are being measured using the same fiber optical path).
        For this reason this element is optional.
    :ivar last_update: Date and time the Calibration was last modified
        in the source application or, if that information is not
        available, when it was last saved to the format file. This is

    :ivar originator: Name (or other human-readable identifier) of the
        person who initially originated the Calbration. If that
        information is not available, then this is the user who created
        the format file. The originator remains the same as the object
        is subsequently edited. This is the equivalent in ISO 19115 to
        the CI_Individual.name or the CI_Organization.name of the

        is used as the input to a Calibration, then a Data Object
        Reference to that object can be inserted with this element.
    :ivar pipeline_datum: In the event that the facility kind is a
        pipeline, this element is used to record the datum from which
        facility (pipeline) length is referenced.  The type is a string
        since there is currently no standard enum for this type of data.
        It is expected that the value would be a string to describe, eg
        one end of the pipe from which measurement is made.
    :ivar remark: Textual description about the value of this field.
    :ivar wellbore_datum: In the event that the facility kind is a
        wellbore, this element is used to record the datum from which

class DasFbe:
    """This object contains the attributes of FBE processed data.

    This includes the FBE data unit, location of the FBE data along the
    fiber optical path, information about times, (optional) filter
    related parameters, and UUIDs of the original raw and/or spectra
    files from which the files were processed. Note that the actual FBE
    data samples and times arrays are not present in the XML files but
    only in the HDF5 files because of their size. The XML files only
    contain references to locate the corresponding HDF files containing
    the actual FBE samples and times.

    :ivar fbe_data_unit: Data unit for the FBE data.
    :ivar fbe_description: Description of the FBE data.
    :ivar fbe_index: The nth (zero-based) count of this FBE instance in
        the Acquisition.  Recommended if there is more than 1 FBE
        instance in this Acquisition.  This index corresponds to the FBE
        array number in the HDF5 file.
    :ivar filter_type: A string describing the type of filter applied by
        the vendor. Important frequency type filter classes are:
        frequency response filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass,
        notch filters) and butterworth, chebyshev and bessel filters.
        The filter type and characteristics applied to the acquired or
        processed data is important information for end-user
        applications.
    :ivar number_of_loci: The total number of ‘loci’ (acoustic sample
        points) acquired by the measurement instrument in a single
        ‘scan’ of the fiber.
    :ivar output_data_rate: The rate at which the FBE data is provided
        for all ‘loci’ (spatial samples). This is typically equal to the
        interrogation rate/pulse rate of the DAS measurement system or
        an integer fraction thereof. Note this attribute is mandatory
        for FBE and spectrum data. For raw data this attribute is
        optional.
    :ivar raw_reference: A universally unique identifier (UUID) for the
        HDF file containing the raw data.
    :ivar spatial_sampling_interval: The separation between two
        consecutive ‘spatial sample’ points on the fiber at which the
        signal is measured. It should not be confused with ‘spatial
        resolution’. If this data element is present in the DASFbe
        object, then it overwrites the SpatialSamplingInterval value
        described in DASAcquistion.
    :ivar spatial_sampling_interval_unit: Only required in Hdf5 file to
        record the unit of measure of the sampling interval of the Fbe.
    :ivar spectra_reference: A universally unique identifier (UUID) for
        the HDF file containing the spectra data.
    :ivar start_locus_index: The first ‘locus’ acquired by the
        interrogator unit, where ‘Locus Index 0’ is the acoustic sample
        point at the connector of the measurement instrument.
    :ivar transform_size: The number of samples used in the
        TransformType.
    :ivar transform_type: A string describing the type of mathematical
        transformation applied by the vendor. Typically this is some
        type of discrete fast Fourier transform (often abbreviated as
        DFT, DFFT or FFT).
    :ivar window_function: The window function applied to the sample
        window used to calculate the frequency band. Example 'HANNING',
        'HAMMING', 'BESSEL' window.
    :ivar window_overlap: The number of sample overlaps between
        consecutive filter windows applied.
    :ivar window_size: The number of samples in the filter window
        applied.
    :ivar custom:
    :ivar fbe_data: A DAS array object containing the FBE DAS data.
    :ivar fbe_data_time: A DAS array object containing the sample times
        corresponding to a single ‘scan’ of the fiber. In a single
        ‘scan’, the DAS measurement system acquires raw data samples for
        all the loci specified by StartLocusIndex and NumberOfLoci. The
        ‘scan’ frequency is equal to the DAS acquisition pulse rate.
    :ivar uuid: A universally unique identifier (UUID) of an instance of
        FBE DAS data.

    times and trigger times arrays are not present in the XML files but
    only in the HDF5 files because of their size. The XML files only
    contain references to locate the corresponding HDF files, which
    contain the actual raw samples, times, and (optional) trigger times.

        points) acquired by the measurement instrument in a single
        ‘scan’ of the fiber.
    :ivar output_data_rate: The rate at which the spectra data is
        provided for all ‘loci’ (spatial samples). This is typically
        equal to the interrogation rate/pulse rate of the DAS
        measurement system or an integer fraction thereof. This
        attribute is optional in the Raw Data object. If present, it

class ProductFlowPort:
    """
    Product Flow Port Schema.

    :ivar comment: A descriptive remark associated with this port.
    :ivar direction: Defines whether this port is an inlet or outlet.
        This is a nominal intended direction.
    :ivar exposed: True ("true" or "1") indicates that the port is an
        exposed internal port and cannot be used in a connection
        external to the unit. False ("false" or "0") or not given
        indicates a normal port.
    :ivar facility: The name of the facility represented by this
        ProductFlowPort The name can be qualified by a naming system.
        The facility name is assumed to be unique within the context of
        the facility represented by the unit. This also defines the kind
        of facility.
    :ivar facility_alias: An alternative name of a facility. This is
        generally unique within a naming system. The above contextually
        unique name should also be listed as an alias.
    :ivar name: The name of the port within the context of the product
        flow unit.
    :ivar plan_name: The name of a network plan. This indicates a
        planned port. All child network components must all be planned
        and be part of the same plan. The parent unit must be part of
        the same plan or be an actual. Not specified indicates an actual
        port.
    :ivar connected_node: Defines the node to which this port is
        connected. A timestamp activates and deactivates the connection.
        Only one connectedNode should be active at any one point in
        time. There are no semantics for the node except common
        connection. All ports that are connected to a node with the the
        same name are inherently connected to each other. The name of
        the node is only required to be unique within the context of the
        current Product Flow Network (that is, not the overall model).
        All ports must be connected to a node and whether or not any
        other port is connected to the same node depends on the
        requirements of the network. Any node that is internally
        connected to only one port is presumably a candidate to be
        connected to an external node. The behavior of ports connected
        at a common node is as follows: a) There is no pressure drop
        across the node. All ports connected to the node have the same
        pressure. That is, there is an assumption of steady state fluid
        flow. b) Conservation of mass exists across the node. The mass
        into the node via all connected ports equals the mass out of the
        node via all connected ports. c) The flow direction of a port
        connected to the node may be transient. That is, flow direction
        may change toward any port(s) if the relative internal pressure
        of the Product Flow Units change and a new steady state is
        achieved.
    :ivar expected_flow_property: Defines the properties that are
        expected to be measured at this port. This can also specify the
        equipment tag(s) of the sensor that will read the value. Only
        one of each property kind should be active at any point in time.
    :ivar expected_flow_product: Defines the expected flow and product
        pairs to be assigned to this port by a Product Volume report. A
        set of expected qualifiers can be defined for each pair.
    :ivar uid: A unique identifier for this data element. It is not
        globally unique (not a uuid) and only need be unique within the
        context of the parent top-level object.

    :ivar facility: The name of the facility for which this Product Flow

        the external ports on the internal network must match the names
        of the ports on this unit. That is they are logically the same
        ports.
    :ivar name: The name of the ProductFlowUnit within the context of
        the ProductFlowNetwork.
    :ivar plan_name: The name of a network plan. This indicates a
        planned unit. All child network components must all be planned
        and be part of the same plan. The parent network must either
        contain the plan (i.e., be an actual) or be part of the same
        plan. Not specified indicates an actual unit.
    :ivar expected_property: Defines an expected property of the

    :ivar port: An inlet or outlet port associated with this unit. If
        there is an internal network then the name of this port must
        match the name of an external port for that network. Any
        properties (e.g., volume, pressure, temperature) that are
        assigned to this port are inherently assigned to the
        corresponding external port on the internal network. That is,
        the ports are logically the same port. Similar to a node, there
        is no pressure drop across a port. Also similar to a node,
        conservation of mass exists across the port and the flow
        direction across the port can change over time if the relative
        pressures across connected units change.
    :ivar relative_coordinate: Defines the relative coordinate of the
